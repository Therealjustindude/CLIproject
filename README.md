# CLIproject

Welcome to my Tequila Drink CLI. You will be given a list of Tequila drinks provided by TheCocktailDB. Once you see that list you can choose a drink by its number which will return a shopping list for you. You can then move on to see instructions for that drink. You have the option to go back to the list or exit at any point in the application. Enjoy!
